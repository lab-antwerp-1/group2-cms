## pizza instructions

A small pizzeria in the center of Antwerp wants to offer a website for customers
where they can make reservations online in order to dine in. When customers make
their reservations they already have to select the pizza's they would like to
eat, so the food is ready once the guests arrive.

Every pizza that the pizzeria makes is tailor made for the needs of the specific
customer. Customers must first choose the size of the pizza (small, medium or
large). A small pizza starts at 8€, a medium pizza starts at 10€ and a large one
starts at 15€. Once a size has been chosen the customer has to select a dough,
here the options are Pan, Classic or Cheezy Crust. Both Pan and Classic are
included in the price, but if the user selects a cheezy crust pizza he will have
to pay a supplement of 3€.

Once the type of dough has been decided the customer can add as many toppings as
they would like to the pizza. Every topping has its own price. On the online
menu card we want to show icons for toppings that are vegan. We also want to
indicate how spicy a topping is. A topping can be (not spicy at all, a little
spicy, medium spicy and very spicy).
